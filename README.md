This is a Score keeper for people who are playing a game which requires two players. The game can be ping pong, four square, or even soccer/basketball. It depend on the players on the team.
I made the score keeper with two players in mind. we have a button for player 1 and player 2. the score reader shows what number a player must get to win the game.
If we set the score keeper to 3, the player who scores 3 points first, wins. When a player wins their number will turn green and when they lose the number will turn red. 

The players are able to reset and choose a different winning score for the next round by selecting reset a new number. the numbers increment by 3s so it goes up to 30 points.
